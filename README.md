# Hidden Treasures
This website performs the functions for user accounts to keep track of, buy, and sell inventory. It uses a LAMP stack for the backend, and utilizes pure JavaScript-made components for the header ([header.js](/scripts/components/header.js)) and left-side information box ([infobox.js](/scripts/components/infobox.js)) on multiple pages. It's payment functionality uses demo currency, so items are safe to buy and sell as one pleases. This project was built with real client-needs in mind, was an incredible learning curve for me and my partner, Caleb Turnbow, and I hope you find it interesting as well.</br>
